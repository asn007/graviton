graviton
========

Relations and models for Meteor collections.

Allows you to:

* Define relationships between collections.
* Traverse and retrieve related models.
* Tansform your mongo docs into models with attributes and methods.
* Use other mrt packages to handle validation (meteor-simple-schema) hooks (meteor-collection-hooks) and relational pub/sub (reactive-relations).
 
Collections defined with Graviton automatically convert retreieved objects into models. You specify the type(s) when define the collection. Passing {transform: null} to find() etc. will bypass model transformation. The raw document is stored in model.attributes. Use built-in transformation methods like set, push, pop to make changes to your model locally. Call model.save() to persist changes to the database. All methods work on both server and client.

# API Docs

## Meteor.Collection.prototype
The following are added to all your meteor collections:
* `all()` alias to find().fetch()
* `build()` returns a new local Gravition.Model based on your collection definition. Does not save to db.
* `create()` calls build() to generate a Model then inserts it into the db.

## Graviton
* `Graviton.define(collectionName, options)` Use to define your collections. Returns a Meteor.Collection instantiated with a transform function based on the options passed.

  *Options*
    * `persist` passing false will define a local collection. default=true
    * `modelCls` either a model constructor generated by calling Graviton.Model.extend or an object like {key1: ModelClsA, key2: ModelClsB} if you want polymorphism. collection.build({_type: 'key2'}) would return an instance of ModelClsB.
    * `defaultType` used when supplying a object for modelCls. Specify the type to use when object being transformed does not contain _type.
    * `timestamps` if true and you have the collection-hooks package installed, createdAt and updatedAt timestamps will be added to your models.
    * `<relationName>` use to define relationships with other collections. See Relation section below.
* `Gravition.getProperty`
